# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new, minimal repository containing only a README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial state with no source code, build tools, or development infrastructure yet implemented.

## Current State


bruh
- Repository is initialized with Git
- Contains only a basic README.md with project name "first-project-v2"
- No package managers, build tools, or development dependencies configured
- No source code files present

## Development Notes

Since this is a new project without established tooling or architecture, future development will need to:
- Determine the technology stack and programming language
- Set up appropriate package management and build tools
- Establish project structure and coding conventions
- Add development, testing, and deployment workflows

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project evolves and gains structure.
